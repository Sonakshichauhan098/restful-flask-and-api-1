    "Restful API & Flask Assignment \n",
    "1. What is a RESTful API? \n",
    "● A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a way for two computer \n",
    "systems to communicate over the internet using the principles of REST architecture. It \n",
    "is one of the most common types of web APIs used in modern web and mobile \n",
    "applications. \n",
    "2. Explain the concept of API specification? \n",
    "● An API Specification is a detailed blueprint or contract that describes how an API \n",
    "should behave. It tells developers exactly how to interact with the API—what \n",
    "endpoints are available, what parameters to send, what responses to expect, and how \n",
    "errors will be handled. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " What Does an API Specification Include? \n",
    "1. Endpoints \n",
    "● The available URLs for accessing resources. \n",
    "● Example: /users, /products/{id} \n",
    "2. HTTP Methods \n",
    "● GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. \n",
    "3. Request Parameters \n",
    "● Query parameters (?page=2), headers, path variables (/users/{id}), and request body. \n",
    "4. Response Format \n",
    "● Structure of the data returned by the API, usually in JSON or XML. \n",
    "5. Status Codes \n",
    "● Standard HTTP codes to indicate the result of the request: \n",
    "● 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, etc. \n",
    "6. Authentication Requirements \n",
    "● Tokens, API keys, OAuth, etc. \n",

    "�\n",
    " Purpose: \n",
    "The main goal of url_for() is to ensure that URL building in your app is: \n",
    "● Dynamic (updates automatically if route changes) \n",
    "● Reliable (avoids typos and broken links) \n",
    "● Clean and maintainable \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " How It Works: \n",
    "● Instead of writing URLs as plain strings (like /home), you refer to the name of the view \n",
    "function, and Flask will generate the correct URL for you. \n",
    "Example- \n",
    "@app.route('/dashboard') \n",
    "def dashboard(): \n",

    "│   \n",
    "└── index.html \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " How It Works \n",
    "● Flask automatically looks for static files in the /static/ directory. \n",
    "● These files can be accessed in your browser using the URL: \n",
    "http://localhost:5000/static/filename \n",
    "18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API? \n",
    "● \n",
    "✅\n",
    " An API specification is a formal, structured description of how an API should \n",
    "behave. It defines the endpoints, HTTP methods, request and response formats, \n",
    "parameters, authentication rules, and error codes that the API will use. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Key Elements Typically Included: \n",
    "● Base URL: The root path of the API (e.g., https://api.example.com) \n",
    "● Endpoints: Paths like /users, /products/ \n",
    "● HTTP Methods: Such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE \n",
    "● Request Parameters: Inputs via path, query, or body \n",
    "● Response Format: Usually JSON or XML \n",
    "● Status Codes: Such as 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error \n",
    "● Authentication: Like API keys, JWT tokens, OAuth \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " How It Helps in Building a Flask API \n",
    "1.Clear Structure and Planning \n",
    "● The specification acts as a design document, helping developers plan the structure \n",
    "and behavior of the Flask API before writing code. \n",
    "2.Improves Collaboration \n",
    "● Frontend and backend developers can work independently using the API spec as a \n",
    "shared contract. \n",
    "3.Documentation Generation \n",
    "● Tools like Swagger (OpenAPI) can generate interactive documentation directly from \n",
    "the spec, making it easier for others to understand and use the API. \n",
    "4.Easier Testing and Validation \n",
    "● With a defined specification, it becomes easier to test endpoints and validate inputs \n",
    "and outputs consistently. \n",
    "5.Better Maintainability \n",
    "● A spec ensures that the API remains consistent and understandable even as the \n",
    "project grows or changes over time \n",
    "19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API? \n",
    "● \n",
    "✅\n",
    " HTTP status codes are standardized 3-digit numerical codes that a web server \n",
    "returns in response to an HTTP request made by a client (like a browser or an API \n",
    "consumer). \n",
    "● These codes indicate the outcome of the request, such as: \n",
    "● Whether it was successful, \n",
    "● If there was an error, \n",
    "● Or if further action is needed. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Why Are They Important in a Flask API? \n",
    "1.Clear Communication \n",
    "● Status codes allow the server (Flask app) to communicate the result of a request \n",
    "clearly to the client (e.g., browser, mobile app, frontend). \n",
    "2.Improved Error Handling \n",
    "● The client can detect problems (like 404 Not Found or 400 Bad Request) and take \n",
    "appropriate actions. \n",
    "3.Helps Debugging \n",
    "● Developers can easily identify what went wrong in the request/response cycle. \n",
    "4.Follows REST Standards \n",
    "● Proper use of status codes makes a Flask API RESTful and aligns it with industry \n",
    "standards. \n",
    "5.Better User Experience \n",
    "● Applications using the API can show meaningful messages or actions to users based \n",
    "on the status code. \n",
    "20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask? \n",
    "● \n",
    "✅\n",
    " What is a POST Request? A POST request is used to send data from the client \n",
    "(such as a form or app) to the server, typically to create a new resource. In Flask, you \n",
    "can handle POST requests using the @app.route() decorator with methods=[\"POST\"]. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Example: Handling a POST Request in Flask \n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify \n",
    "app = Flask(__name__) \n",
    "@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST']) \n",
    "def submit_data(): \n",
    "# Get JSON data from the request \n",
    "data = request.get_json() \n",
    "name = data.get('name') \n",
    "age = data.get('age') \n",
    "return jsonify({\"message\": \"Data received\", \"name\": name, \"age\": \n",
    "age}), 201 \n",
    "21. How would you secure a Flask API? \n",
    "● \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Securing a Flask API is essential to protect data, prevent unauthorized access, and \n",
    "ensure safe communication between clients and the server. Here’s a theoretical \n",
    "overview of how to secure a Flask API effectively: \n",
    "✅\n",
    " 1. Authentication \n",
    "Authentication verifies who the user is. \n",
    "Common methods: \n",
    "● API Keys: Send a secret key in headers (X-API-Key) with each request. \n",
    "JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Token-based system for stateless authentication. \n",
    "OAuth 2.0: Used for third-party logins (like Google, GitHub). \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Example with JWT: \n",
    "from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, jwt_required \n",
    "# Initialize JWT \n",
    "app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key' \n",
    "jwt = JWTManager(app) \n",
    "@app.route('/protected') \n",
    "@jwt_required() \n",
    "def protected(): \n",
    "return jsonify(message=\"Access granted\") \n",
    "✅\n",
    " 2. Authorization \n",
    "Authorization determines what the user is allowed to do. \n",
    "Example: A user may be allowed to read a post, but not delete it. You implement this by \n",
    "checking user roles or permissions in each endpoint. \n",
    "✅\n",
    " 3. HTTPS (SSL/TLS) \n",
    "Always run your Flask app over HTTPS, not HTTP. It encrypts the communication between \n",
    "client and server to protect sensitive data. \n",
    "✅\n",
    " 4. Input Validation and Sanitization \n",
    "● Never trust user input. Use validation to prevent: \n",
    "● SQL Injection \n",
    "● XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) \n",
    "● CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) \n",
    "✔\n",
    " Use libraries like: \n",
    "● marshmallow for JSON schema validation \n",
    "● WTForms for form validation \n",
    "✅\n",
    " 5. Rate Limiting \n",
    "Prevent abuse or DDoS attacks by limiting the number of requests per user/IP. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Use Flask extensions like: \n",
    "● Flask-Limiter \n",
    "✅\n",
    " 6. Use Environment Variables for Secrets \n",
    "Never hardcode API keys or passwords. Store them securely using: \n",
    "● .env files + python-dotenv \n",
    "● Environment variables (os.environ) \n",
    "✅\n",
    " 7. Error Handling \n",
    "Never expose internal server errors to users. Instead: \n",
    "● Show generic error messages \n",
    "● Log details on the backend for debugging \n",
    "✅\n",
    " 8. Enable CORS Carefully \n",
    "If your API is accessed from browsers, configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) \n",
    "securely. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Use: \n",
    "from flask_cors import CORS \n",
    "CORS(app, resources={r\"/api/*\": {\"origins\": \"https://your-frontend.com\"}}) \n",
    "22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension? \n",
    "● \n",
    "✅\n",
    " Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that helps you quickly build RESTful APIs \n",
    "by providing tools and abstractions for: \n",
    "● Routing \n",
    "● Request parsing \n",
    "● Input validation \n",
    "● Standardized response formatting \n",
    "It is built on top of Flask and simplifies the process of creating clean, modular, and \n",
    "maintainable API code. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Significance / Benefits of Using Flask-RESTful \n",
    "1. \n",
    "✅\n",
    " Class-Based Resource Handling \n",
    "● Allows you to define API endpoints using Python classes instead of functions. \n",
    "● Each HTTP method is defined as a method (get(), post(), etc.) in a class. \n",
    "from flask_restful import Resource \n",
    "class Hello(Resource): \n",
    "def get(self): \n",
    "return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"} \n",
    "2. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Simplified Routing with Api Class \n",
    "● You use the Api object to manage routes cleanly. \n",
    "from flask_restful import Api \n",
    "api = Api(app) \n",
    "api.add_resource(Hello, '/hello') \n",
    "3. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Automatic Request \n",
    "● Easily handle JSON and form data using reqparse. \n",
    "from flask_restful import reqparse \n",
    "parser = reqparse.RequestParser() \n",
    "parser.add_argument('name', type=str, required=True) \n",
    "args = parser.parse_args() \n",
    "4. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Standardized Response Format Returns are automatically converted into JSON, \n",
    "with proper HTTP status codes. \n",
    "return {'message': 'Item created'}, 201 \n",
    "5. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Modular and Clean Code \n",
    "● Encourages RESTful design patterns and separates logic for each resource. \n",
    "6. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Easy Integration with Flask Ecosystem \n",
    "● Works well with Flask extensions like: \n",
    "● Flask-JWT-Extended (for authentication) \n",
    "● Flask-SQLAlchemy (for database) \n",
    "● Flask-CORS (for cross-origin requests) \n",
    "23. What is the role of Flask’s session object? \n",
    "● In Flask, the session object is used to store data across requests for a specific user. It \n",
    "allows you to remember information (like login status or user preferences) from one \n",
    "request to the next. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " Why is session important:- \n",
    "● HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning each request is independent and doesn’t \n",
    "\"remember\" the previous one. \n",
    "● The session object gives Flask the ability to maintain state between different requests \n",
    "from the same client. \n",
    "�\n",
    "�\n",
    " How It Works: \n",
    "● Flask uses secure cookies to store session data on the client side. \n",
    "● The data is signed cryptographically using a secret key so it cannot be tampered with. \n",
    "Example: \n",
    "from flask import Flask, session, redirect, url_for, request \n",
    "app = Flask(__name__) \n",
    "app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key' \n",
    "@app.route('/login', methods=['POST']) \n",
    "def login(): \n",
    "username = request.form['username'] \n",
    "session['username'] = username \n",
    "return f\"Welcome, {username}!\" \n",
    "@app.route('/logout') \n",
    "def logout(): \n",
    "session.pop('username', None) \n",
